This is a directory with groups of submodules of plugins to vim.

Directories are loaded alphabetically.

Directories:

- `aaa_staging` - new plugins for testing, that if are ok, will be moved further
- `pathogen` - just with vim-pathogen for managing that mess
- `zzz_utils` - vim-workspace needs to be loaded after NERDTree, so got moved there
