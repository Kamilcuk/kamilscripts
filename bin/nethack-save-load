SUMMARY

  Saves or loads nethack save state.

DESCRIPTION

  You must save before in nethack for this to work.
  
  You cannot use this script while nethack is running: nethack must be off for saving and loading!!!

  Output save dir is created automatically each time the script is run.

  When saving, save state cannot contain "__"

  When loading, inputing "__" loads the last saved game

INSTALLATION

  Nethack dir, output save dir must and save separtor must be specified by
  modifying the variables SEP, NETHACK_SAVE_DIR and NETHACK_STATE_DIR at the beginning
  of the source code of this script.

  If you do this after saving, old saves will be lost.

SAMPLE CALLS

  #first save nethack with S command.
  #while the game is quit use:

  nethack-save-load s 1; nethack    #saves state 1, and comes back to the game
  nethack-save-load s "hard part"; nethack   #saves state "hard part"
  nethack-save-load s "as__df";  # forbidden because name contains magic sequence "__"

  #to load a state, quit with #quit
  #while the game is quit do:

  nethack-save-load l 1; nethack    # loads state 1, and comes back to the game
  nethack-save-load l "hard part"; nethack    # loads state "hard part"
  nethack-save-load l __; nethack    # loads last saved game (magic sequence "__")

  #when you start the game it should be back at last place.
  #TIP: hit up on the terminal to access terminal history after loading and saving to quickly load and save.
